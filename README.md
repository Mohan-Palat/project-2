# Project 2. üåÖ ACME Investments - Plans Participants Funds


## 1. Technologies used

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Google Chrome
* Express Node.js Web App Framework, 
* EJS Templates to implement MVC (Model‚Äìview‚Äìcontroller) design Pattern
* REST (Representational state transfer) Architecture using JavaScript and JSON
* Materialize Framework for styling (Based on Google Material Design) 
* Object-oriented, dynamic, scalable NoSQL database MongoDB on Cloud 
* Compass GUI for MongoDB
* Mongoose ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js
* MongoDB Atlas to connect to cloud service provider of choice - AWS
* Heroku Cloud Application Platform for Deployment
* Deployed at https://mohan-project-2.herokuapp.com/

## 2. Learning Experience

* MongoDB / Mongoose - The NoSQL and Object Oriented Database is new to me and quite exciting. I am used to traditional relational databases like DB2, MS SQL Server, Sybase or Star Schema Focus
* EJS Layouts Party Hat / Squiggleys <% %> to embed dynamic JavaScript code in HTML is pretty nice
* The Materialize library was a pleasure to work with - providing out of the box styling elements. Some of the good features I found after solidifying the MVP have been added to a special page named Plan Sponsor Email

## 3. Approach & Design Components - Wireframe, REST Table and Seeding

### 3.1 Wireframe

![Wireframe](./images/Project-2-Wireframe.jpg)  

### 3.2 REST Table

Each of tht Plan RESTful routes were coded based on the table below

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Rt#</th>
<th>Path</th>
<th>HTTP Verb</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
<th>Mongoose Method</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>/plans</td>
<td>GET</td>
<td>List all plans </td>
<td>Plan.find()</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>/plans/new</td>
<td>GET</td>
<td>Show new plan form</td>
<td>N/A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>/plans</td>
<td>POST</td>
<td>Create a new plan, then redirect somewhere</td>
<td>Plan.create()</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>/plans/:id</td>
<td>GET</td>
<td>Show info about one specific plan</td>
<td>Plan.findById()</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>/plans/:id/edit</td>
<td>GET</td>
<td>Show edit form for one plan</td>
<td>Plan.findById()</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>/plans/:id</td>
<td>PUT</td>
<td>Update particular plan, then redirect somewhere</td>
<td>Plan.findByIdAndUpdate()</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td>/plans/:id</td>
<td>DELETE</td>
<td>Delete a particular plan, then redirect somewhere</td>
<td>Plan.findByIdAndRemove()</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### 3.3 Seed Processes

Data for the collections were generated using stand alone Seed process listed below

```JavaScript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const Plan = require('../models/plan');
const Participant = require('../models/participant');
const mongoURI = 'mongodb://localhost/project-2-dev';
mongoose.connect(
  mongoURI,
  {
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true,
    useFindAndModify: false,
    useCreateIndex: true,
  },
  () => {
    console.log('the connection with mongod is established');
  }
);
(async function () {
  //await mongoose.connection.dropCollection('plans');
  //await mongoose.connection.dropCollection('participants');
  // CREATE TWO PARTICIPANTS
  const gates = await Participant.create({
    partName: 'Bill Gates',
    partSsn: '123-45-6789',
    partIsHce: true, // Higly Compensated Employee :D
    partIsActive: true,
  });
  const palat = await Participant.create({
    partName: 'Mohan Palat',
    partSsn: '987-65-4321',
    partIsHce: false, 
    partIsActive: true,
  });
  // CREATE TWO PLANS
  const aesp = new Plan({
    planName: 'ACME Employee Savings Plan',
    planIsInstitutional: true,
    participants: [],
  });
  const map401k = new Plan({
    planName: 'Mom and Pop 401k Plan',
    planIsInstitutional: false,
    participants: [],
  });
  // PUSH THE PARTICIPANTS ONTO THE PLAN'S
  // PARTICIPANTS ARRAY (ASSOCIATE!)
  aesp.participants.push(gates);
  map401k.participants.push(palat); 
  aesp.save(function (err, plan) {
    if (err) {
      console.log(err);
    } else {
      console.log('first plan is ', plan);
    }
  });
  map401k.save(function (err, plan) {
    if (err) {
      console.log(err);
    } else {
      console.log('second plan is ', plan);
    }
  });
})();
```

## 4. Technical Requirements

Company ACME Retirement Investments deals with clients who will become participants investing in plans which ACME will offer them. Plans are a combination of funds which are investment vehicles which the participants can invest in by buying shares. I was recruited as a full stack deeloper to develop web forms which could maintain all the plans ACME offers, participants who have invested in each plan and their association 

### 4.1 Problem: 

ACME wants to maintain (Create, Read, Update, Delete) their plans, participants and maybe the funds belonging to the plan and the associations between using a web app.

### 4.2 Solution and who would use it

It will be used by the Plan/Participant Maintenance and Plan Sponsor team to view the plan properties and how they can improve the participant experience on web.

#### 4.2.1 UI Soutioning
Used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Google Chrome, Express Node.nj Framework, EJS Templates and Materialize Framework for styling 

#### 4.2.2 Data Storage Soutioning
MongoDB/Compass and Mongoose ODM 

#### 4.2.3 Solutioning Cloud Deployment to AWS
Heroku Cloud Application Platform for Deploment

## 7. Compliance to Stretch Goals, Recommended Features üîµ 

* Add additional relationships **Added Fund Model with an embedded association**

* Use EJS Partials **Complete**
* Include portfolio-quality styling **Almost**
* Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap **Using Materialize Framework**
* Incorporate Google Maps **Did not complete**

## 8. Unsolved Issues and Future Enhancements

* Fund Model was added. The model needs to be associated to Plans and Participants and eventually provide pages using Mongoose .populate() method to a) Given a prticipant, list all associated plans and funds b) Given a plan, provide a list of available funds. 
* Currently there is an issue with the responsive presentation of the UI - The top right menu has been coded to disappear and a hamburger menu appears when size becomes tablet size or lower. If you click the hamburger menu a pullin menu is supposed to slide in from left side. Instead of the slide in menu I am getting the regular menu appearing below the hamburger icon. For now there is a cluster of buttons at the bottom which can be used on tablets and cell phones.

## 9. Mongoose Models and MongoDB Associations used

Plan to Participant is one to many relationship
To match with relational databases, implemented with referenced association
Fund to Price is also one to many implemented with embedded form of association

```JavaScript

  // embed prices in fund
  prices: [dailyPriceSchema],

// FUND PRICE GETTER

dailyPriceSchema.path('price').get(function(num) {
  return (num / 100).toFixed(2);
});

// FUND PRICE SETTER

dailyPriceSchema.path('price').set(function(num) {
  return num * 100;
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Fund', fundSchema);

/*
